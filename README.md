# Face-pose-statement-NTI
The project is a part of the graduation requirements at the National Telecommunication  Institute (NTI).
This project aims to create a system that can determine the direction a person's face is looking in a photo.
By analyzing images, the system can estimate how a face is oriented, such as whether it's turned left, right, up, or down. 
This capability has many practical uses, like enhancing augmented reality experiences or improving facial recognition systems.
